Concept for user activity notifications
=======================================
An option will be added to each new thread that a user submits whether or not they want to receive notifications for the thread.

Query: what about adding a user setting that determines whether or not the user wants to receive notifications. If yes, each new
thread will forward notifications to the user about activity on it.

Don't notify about the user replying to their own thread.
Don't notify about replies to individual posts on a thread. This will get spammy.

Procedure
---------
1. Create a new Notifications model { Id, ThreadId, Sender (UserId who replied), Date, Read (bool) }
2. Add a new field to a Thread indicating that the author wishes to receive notifications.
3. Add the field to the New Post view when the new post is not a reply to an existing thread.
4. When posting a reply to a thread, evaluate if the thread has notifications enabled.
4.1 If the thread has notifications enabled, write a new Notification to the Notifications table
5. Each page load or postback needs to check notifications and update the user's list of unread notifications.
